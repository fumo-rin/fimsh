Daiyousei: It's over. You are too late.
Cirno: Dai-chan! We are on an important mission!
Daiyousei: Yes! A mission to drop uranium rods in the lake!
Daiyousei: but you see... I've already dropped uranium rods in this here lake!
Cirno: !
Okuu: !
Rin: Mewo mewo.
Daiyousei: Since you are here, i will take the rods from you!
Daiyousei: And also drop them in the lake!
Cirno: It is OUR mission! It's very important!
Okuu: Perhaps we will throw you in the lake as well!
Rin: Mewo mewo.
Daiyousei: The lake is not big enough for the both of us.
Daiyousei: Begone, but leave your uranium rods.
Okuu: We can't do that. Our grand plan is very important.
Cirno: The grand plan!
Daiyousei: Then you leave me no choice.
Daiyousei: Raise your fists, and get ready for a beating!
